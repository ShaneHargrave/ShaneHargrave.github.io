                <p>Using the picture above shows alot of information about any given star.
                    The vertical position of the peak shows how bright a star is. The brightness of the star depends on temperature and size.
                    The horizontal position of the peak shows us the color of the star. The color only depends on the temperature of the star.
                    When comparing the stars in the image, Star E is very hot and blue and Star F is cool and red.

                <h2>Why do we see this?</h2>
                <p>When light passes through gas, atoms in the gas can only absorb or emit specific wavelengths of light.
                    The wavelengths absorbed or emitted are specific to each element independent of temperature.
                    By looking at the absorption or emission lines, elements can be identified.
                    The continuous spectrum shows temperature and relative size while absorption and emission show composition.

                    A wavelength is the horizontal distance between the two peaks of a wave.
                    Nanometers(nm) are used to measure light wavelengths. The color purple/violet has the shortest wavelength at 380nm-440nm.
                    Blue and light blue have a range of 440nm-510nm. Green has a range of 510nm-565nm. Yellow has a range of 565nm-590nm. Orange has a range of 590nm-625nm.
                    Red has the longest wavelengths, 625nm-740nm.

                <p>Luminosity: The total amount of light a star radiates into space.</p>
                <p>Absolute Magnitude: The magnutude a star would have at a distance of 10 parsecs (a measure of Luminosity).</p>
                <p>Apparent Brightness: How much light from the star reaches Earth.</p>
                <p>Apparent Magnitude: The observed magnitude of a star (a measure of brightness).</p>
                <p>Parsec: the distance to an object with a parallax of 1 arcsecond (3.26 light years).</p>
                <p>Parallax: Nearby objects appear to move relative to distant objects when viewed from different positions.
                    Parallax is measured in arcseconds (1 arcsecond = 1/3600th of a degree). The greater the distance the smaller the parallax.

                <p>Main Sequence: Stars fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. Most stars spend their life within this line.</p>
                <p>Giants and Supergiants: Old stars that have used up their hydrogen and are now fusing heavier elements.</p>
                <p>White Dwarfs: Remains of dead stars, exposed stellar cores radiation away leftover heat.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Stars that have a solar mass of 0.6 and below are very low mass starts. These stars are born small and stay small for their life. They eventually end in a white dwarf.
                    Stars with 0.6 - 8 solar masses are low mass stars. These stars form small and stay small for awhile. Eventually as the star gets older it will turn into a red giant. These stars will also eventually end up as white dwarfs.
                    High mass stars are stars with solar masses of above 8. These stars are born big and keep getting bigger throughout their lifetime. These stars are called supergiants. As they get older they collapse and cause a supernova. 
                    The result of the supernova can either be a neutron star or a black hole.
