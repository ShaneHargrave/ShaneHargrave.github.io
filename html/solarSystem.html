                    <li>Diameter: 1,400,000km = 110 Earths</li>

                <br>
                <p>The sun is powered by <b>Nuclear fusion</b>. This process starts in the core of the Sun where hydrogen is converted to helium.
                Photons carry the energy produced through the radiation zone to the convection zone. It takes photons 170,000 years to get from the core to the surface of the Sun.
                The convection zone is apart of the Sun that lays beneath the photosphere. As hot gas rises, cooler gas sinks to the bottom. This creates granules that can be seen in the photosphere. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>Sun spots occur when part of the Sun's magnetic field pokes through the surface. This causes a blockage of hot gas rising.
                    The surrounding area starts to cool and becomes cooler than the surrouning material. This is then seen as dark spots on the Sun.

                    <p>The Sun formed from a giant molecular cloud. These are very large slow moving clouds.
                        As the clound begins to collapse it starts to get hotter. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the clouds starts to spin faster as it gets smaller.
                        The cloud forms a disk due to collisions between particles. In the middle of this disk is all the hot heavy gasses that then form a star.

                <p>The planet is cold and can no longer produce its own internal heat.
                    Because of this there are many craters that can be seen on the surface. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun it has extreme temperatures.
                    During the day it can reach 800 degress Fahrenheit and at night it can reach minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. This massive change in temperature is caused by Mercury having no atmosphere.

                <p>Venus is Earth's "twin" planet. Earth and Venus are similar in size but Venus rotates in the oppsite direction. On Venus the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
                    Similar to Earth, Venus has an atmosphere. It is significantly thicker than Earth's. Venus's atmosphere is mostly composed carbon dioxide with clouds made of sulfuric acid.
                    The surface of the planet is extremely hot. All of the instruments that have been sent to Venus have melted in less than 2 hours. Some of these instruments were able to send images back to Earth.
                    Because of these images we were able to see that Venus has volcanos and mountain ranges. These volcanos play an important role on how Venus got its atmosphere.

                <p>Earth is our home planet. It is the only plantet that we know of that can support life.
                    It is also the only planet in the solar system that has visible liquid water. 
                    Earth exists within a zone called the Habitable zone (Goldilocks Zone). 
                    This means that it is the right distance from the sun for water to remain a liquid.
                    Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gasses. 
                    Because of the iron and nickel within the core, the Earth has its own magnetic field which helps protect the Earth from solar winds.

                <p>Mars the "red planet" is the planet that humans have explored the most. There have been many rovers and probes sent to the planet inorder to find out if life could have existed millions of years ago.
                    Both Earth and Mars experience seasons. The seasons on Mars last longer due to the elliptical orbit around the Sun.
                    The red color of Mars comes from the oxidization of the iron rocks and dust on the surface. Mars is also home to the biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.
                    There have been descoveries that there was once liquid water on Mars a long time ago. Today there is still water on Mars but it is frozen near the poles of the planet.
                    The atmosphere of Mars is thin and is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, notrogen and argon gases. Astronomers believe that Mars once had magnetic field.

                    Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It has more mass than all the planets combined. 
                    Jupiter gained all is mass from the leftover gasses from the Sun. There is no "surface" on Jupiter because it is a jovian planet (gas giant). 
                    This means the planet is made mostly of gas. The primary gasses that make Jupiter apper the way it does are ammonia (yellow), ammonium hydrosulfide (orange), and water (white).
                    These are the clouds we see when looking at Jupiter. There are many storms on Jupiter due to the wind moving in oppsite directions across the planet.
                    One of the main features of Jupiter "The Great Red Spot" is one of the biggest storms.
                    Because the wind blows in many different directions, Jupiter has belts and zones.

                     Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system. It is a gas giant like Jupiter. 
                     Saturn is recognized by its massive rings. Like Jupiter, Saturn is composed of the same gasses.
                     Becuase Saturn is cooler than Jupiter due to its distance from the Sun, the clouds that make Saturn look different.
                     Ammonia clouds are what cover most a Saturn giving it the tan yellow color. Below these clouds there are ammonium hydrosulfide and water clouds.
                     A possible reason for Saturn having rings could be during the formation of Saturn, there could have been many rocky objects that slowly drifted towards the planet.
                     As these rocky objects got closer they were pulled apart by Saturn's gravity (Roche limit) creating a ring of debris. This process would have happened many times over millions of years.

                    According to NASA, William Herschel was the person who discovered Uranus. He wanted to name the planet Georgium Sidus after King George III. 
                    The planet was named Uranus after the Greek god of the sky. This suggestion was made by Johann Bode. Uranus is the only planet that rotates on its side. The planet has a tilt of 97.77 degrees.
                    The reason for this is unknown but the leading idea is that Uranus collied with an Earth sized object in the formation of the early solar system. Uranus is considerd an ice giant rather than a gas giant because the planet made of a hot dence "icy" fluid composed of water, methane, ammonia, and other materials.
                    The blue color of Uranus comes from the methane gas that is in the atmosphere. There is no true surface to the planet.

                    Neptune is a dark and cold planet. Becuase it is so far from the Sun, it is the only planet that can not be seen by the naked eye.
                    The planet is made of the same gasses that formed Uranus. Neptune is the second ice giant in the solar system. The atmosphere of Neptune is similar to Uranus.
                    They share the same blue color. According to NASA, the deeper blue of Neptune is caused by the images being tweaked to better show the features of Neptune.
                    Images of what the two planets may actually look like have been released <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-01-05-new-images-reveal-what-neptune-and-uranus-really-look-0">here</a>.
