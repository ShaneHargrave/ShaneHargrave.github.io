                <p>Key Properties</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diameter: 1,400,000km = 110 Earths</li>
                    <li>Mass: 2 * 10^30kg = 1000x the total mass of everything in the solar system</li>

                    <li>Temperature: Surface 5800 K, Core 15 million K</li>

                <br>
                <p>The sun is powered by <b>Nuclear fusion</b>. This process starts in the core of the Sun where hydrogen is converted to helium.
                Photons carry the energy produced through the radiation zone to the convection zone. It takes photons 170,000 years to get from the core to the surface of the Sun.
                The convection zone is apart of the Sun that lays beneath the photosphere. As hot gas rises, cooler gas sinks to the bottom. This creates granules that can be seen in the photosphere. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>Sun spots occur when part of the Sun's magnetic field pokes through the surface. This causes a blockage of hot gas rising.
                    The surrounding area starts to cool and becomes cooler than the surrouning material. This is then seen as dark spots on the Sun.

                    <p>The Sun formed from a giant molecular cloud. These are very large slow moving clouds.
                        As the clound begins to collapse it starts to get hotter. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the clouds starts to spin faster as it gets smaller.
                        The cloud forms a disk due to collisions between particles. In the middle of this disk is all the hot heavy gasses that then form a star.

                <p>There is not much on Mercury. The planet is cold and can no longer produce its own internal heat.
                    Because of this there are many craters that can be seen on the surface. Because Mercury is so close to the Sun it has extreme temperatures.
                    During the day it can reach 800 degress Fahrenheit and at night it can reach minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit. This massive change in temperature is caused by Mercury having no atmosphere.

                <p>Venus is Earth's "twin" planet. Earth and Venus are similar in size but Venus rotates the oppsite way. On Venus the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.
                    Similar to Earth, Venus has an atmosphere. It is significantly thicker than Earth's. Venus's atmosphere is mostly composed carbon dioxide with clouds made of sulfuric acid.
                    The surface of the planet is extremely hot. All of the instruments that have been sent to Venus have melted in less than 2 hours. Some of these instruments were able to send images back to Earth.
                    Because of these images we were able to see that Venus has volcanos and mountain ranges. These volcanos play an important role on how Venus got its atmosphere.

                <p>Earth is our home planet. It is the only plantet that we know of that can support life.
                    It is also the only planet in the solar system that has visible liquid water. 
                    Earth exists within a zone called the Habitable zone (Goldilocks Zone). 
                    This means that it is the right distance from the sun for water to remain a liquid.
                    Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gasses. 
                    Because of the iron and nickel within the core, the Earth has its own magnetic field which helps protect the Earth from solar winds.

                        When the solar system was forming, there were many small celesital bodies. These objects oftenly collied with eachother until the terristial planets we know formed.
                        Astronomers believe that one of these smaller celesital bodies collided with the young Earth. 
                        As a result of the two bodies colliding, the <a href="../html/moon.html">moon</a> was born.

                <p>Mars the "red planet" is the planet that humans have explored the most. There have been many rovers and probes sent to the planet inorder to find out if life could have existed millions of years ago.
                    Both Earth and Mars experience seasons. The seasons on Mars last longer due to the elliptical orbit around the Sun.
                    The red color of Mars comes from the oxidization of the iron rocks and dust on the surface. Mars is also home to the biggest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.
                    There have been descoveries that there was once liquid water on Mars a long time ago. Today there is still water on Mars but it is frozen near the poles of the planet.
                    The atmosphere of Mars is thin and is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, notrogen and argon gases. Astronomers believe that Mars once had magnetic field.
