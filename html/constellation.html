                <h2>What is a constellation?</h2>
                <div id="moreInfo">
                    <p>A constellation is a "group" of stars that was put together by people for navigation and orientation.
                        Constellations are often named after animals, objects, or mythological subjects. There are 88 official constellations that are recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
                        The constellations help from a map of the night sky. 
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>The stars that make up a constellation are usually not close together. Typically the stars that make the patterns are located very far from eachother.
                        We only see them as a patterns due to the Earth's distance from these stars.
                        Some things to consider when looking for constellations are the <b>azimuth</b> and <b>altitude</b>.
                        Azimuth is a compass direction that starts at 0 degrees and goes to 360 degrees. Altitude is a measuremnt that starts at 0 degrees and ends at 90 degrees (strait above).
                        These are important because if the observer knows either of these then any star can be found. The <b>zenith</b> is also important and it is the point directly above the observer.

                <div id="moreImageInfo">
                    <p>Seasons play an important role in which constellations are visible. Seasons happen due to the tilt of Earth on its axis.
                        When the Northern hemisphere points north (summer). The equator gets more than 12 hours of sunlight.
                        When the Southern hemisphere points south (winter). The equator gets less than 12 hour of sunlight.
                        Depending on the location of the observer and the season, the observer will see different constellations.
                        The image does a good job depicting this.
                        Star charts can also be used to find constellations based on the azimuth and altitude.

                    <p>Polaris is an important star when looking up at the night sky. This star is significant becuase it is the North Star.
                        The North Star is located in the Northern hemisphere and is almost direclty in the middle of the night sky. 
                        Because of this, an observer will never see Polaris rise and set.
                        According to NASA Polaris will not always be the Northern Star. More information on that is provided <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/what-is-the-north-star-and-how-do-you-find-it/">here</a>.
